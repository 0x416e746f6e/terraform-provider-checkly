Hi! We are really excited that you are interested in contributing to Checkly Terraform Provider, and we really appreciate your commitment. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)
- [Development Setup](#development-setup)
- [Scripts](#scripts)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- Always use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/checkly/terraform-provider-checkly/issues/new/choose) to create new issues and select the corresponding issue template.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from a base branch, e.g. `main`, and merge back against that branch.

- [Make sure to tick the "Allow edits from maintainers" box](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork). This allows us to directly make minor edits / refactors and saves a lot of time.

- Add accompanying documentation, usage samples & test cases
- Add or update existing demo files to showcase your changes.
- Use existing resources as templates and ensure that each property has a corresponding `description` field.
- Each PR should be linked with an issue, use [GitHub keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests) for that.
- Be sure to follow up project code styles, you can easily format the code wit these two commands:
  ```sh
  $ make fmt
  ```

- If adding a new feature:
  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a "feature request" issue first and have it approved before working on it (it should has the label "state: confirmed")
  - Each new feature should be linked to

- If fixing a bug:
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. A working demo would be great!

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.

- Make sure tests pass!

- Commit messages must follow the [commit message convention](./commit-convention.md) so that changelogs can be automatically generated. Commit messages are automatically validated before commit (by invoking [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) via [yorkie](https://github.com/yyx990803/yorkie)).

## Development Setup

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull requests should be made against.

### Pre-requirements
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) >= v1.2.2
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) >= 1.18.2

After you have installed Terraform and Go, you can clone the repository and start working on the `main` branch.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.

  > If you don't need the whole git history, you can clone with depth 1 to reduce the download size:

  ```sh
  $ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:checkly/terraform-provider-checkly.git
  ```

2. Navigate into the project and create a new branch:
  ```sh
  cd terraform-provider-checkly && git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
  ```

3. Download go packages
  ```sh
  $ go mod tidy
  ```

4. Run build process to ensure that everyhing is on place
  ```sh
  $ go build
  ```


> ðŸ’¡ We recommend to use [tfswitch](https://tfswitch.warrensbox.com/) to easily manage different Terraform versions in your local environment.

You are ready to go, take a look at the [`dev` script](###`make-dev`) to start testing your changes.

## Scripts

In order to facilitate the development process, we have a `GNUmakefile` with a few scripts that are used to build, test and run working examples.

### `make dev`
This command builds your local project and sets up the provider binary to be used in the `demo` directory.
```sh
$ make dev
```

After you run the `dev` script, you should be able to run terraform with the `demo` sample project:
  1. Navigate to the: `$ cd demo`
  1. Start a new terraform project `terraform init`
  1. Run `terraform plan` and/or `terraform apply`

### `make local-sdk`
If you are also performing updates in the [Checkly Go SDK](https://github.com/checkly/checkly-go-sdk) (ensure to have both projects located  in the same directory), you can use this script to point the provider to the local version of the Checkly Go SDK.
```sh
$ make local-sdk
```

### `make fmt`
Format the code using native terraform and go formatting tools.
```sh
$ make fmt
```

### `make doc`
Use [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs) to automatically generate resources documentation.
```sh
$ make doc
```

### `make testacc`
Run acceptance tests (all test must pass in order to merge a PR).
```sh
$ make testacc
```

## Release Process
The release process is automatically handled with [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) and GitHub `release` action.
To trigger a new release you need to create a new git tag, using [SemVer](https://semver.org) pattenr and then push it to the `main` branch.

Remember to create releases candidates releases and spend some time testing in production before publishin a final version. You can also tag the release as "Pre-Release" on GitHub until you consider it mature enough.
